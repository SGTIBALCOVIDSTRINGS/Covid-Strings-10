covid strings phrase list10=[non-concatenated the controversy over paxlovid is one reminder that treatments are not absolute
pacing is one treatment that can work for this controversy and long covid
the running joke involves the idea that having a conversation post covid is difficult for everyone
a harder task still is finding out exactly where and when covid began
the house of representatives may find some new information on covids origins
until then the cares act and build back better are some legislative solutions to smile about
a third solution is the inflation reduction act 
if covid fraud exists action should be taken
